(macos only instructions. linux should be the same, more or less, but with apt/yum/rpm/etc instead of brew. windows, i have no idea.)

on macs, the easiest way to compile and run this, i believe is:
1. open terminal of your choice (i use [`iTerm2`](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2))
1. install homebrew, if necessary, from [`https://brew.sh/`](https://brew.sh/)
1. to install typescript, follow the instructions [`https://www.typescriptlang.org/download`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download)
1. in this directory, run: `tsc --project tsconfig.json`
1. run a simple webserver of your choice here, something like: `python -m http.server` 
1. that should tell you where to go, but, in my case, i go to [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in any browser.
1. play!

(it may not work, sorry. he's 12. it works for us. YMMV, no support implied or anything. i mean, if you do get support, it'll be from a 12 year old, so, like, take it with a grain of salt.)
